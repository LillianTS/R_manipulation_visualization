# R Data Visualization & Analysis 

This repository contains a collection of R scripts demonstrating data manipulation and data visualization techniques using popular R packages such as `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and more.

## ðŸ“˜ Contents

The R scripts included cover a wide range of topics, including:

- Data wrangling with `dplyr` and pipes (`%>%`)
- Reshaping data using `tidyr`, `reshape`, and `pivot_*` functions
- Creating effective visualizations using `ggplot2`
- Customizing plot aesthetics: colors, scales, themes, and legends
- Time series and date formatting
- Mosaic plots, treemaps, and density plots
- Log scale transformations and statistical smoothing
- Geographic visualization with US map data and crime datasets

## ðŸ›  Key Skills Demonstrated

- Building layered visualizations using `ggplot2`
- Group-wise summarization and categorical plotting
- Handling continuous and discrete color scales
- Creating and customizing advanced plot types: violin plots, mosaic plots, heatmaps, faceted charts
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) with real-world datasets
